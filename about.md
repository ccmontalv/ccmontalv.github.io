I'm an alumnus of Boston College and a Solutions Consultant at Oracle. I strive to expand my worldview through the consumption music, film, and visual art. The maxim of the outdoors, leave it better than you found it, is a principle by which I live. Although my roots are out west, I've ventured east to my new home in Ann Arbor.
